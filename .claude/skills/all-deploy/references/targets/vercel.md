# Target: Vercel

Best for Next.js, Vite, Astro, Remix, Nuxt, SvelteKit, and most static sites. Zero-config for framework projects, preview URLs for every deploy.

> **Check the commercial restriction before choosing Hobby, because it is broader than almost anyone expects.** Vercel's Fair Use Guidelines: *"Commercial usage is defined as any Deployment that is used for the purpose of financial gain of **anyone** involved in **any part of the production** of the project, including a paid employee or consultant writing the code."* Listed examples include *"receiving payment to create, update, or host the site"* and *"the inclusion of advertisements."* So a client's brochure site that sells nothing, carries no ads and takes no payments is still commercial usage **if you were paid to build it**. Asking for donations is explicitly not. If money touches this project anywhere, use Cloudflare Pages or move to Pro. Full text: `https://vercel.com/docs/limits/fair-use-guidelines#commercial-usage`

## Phase 3.5 — prerequisites

```bash
vercel --version                     # >= 32.x recommended
vercel whoami                         # must return an account — if not, ! vercel login
```

If CLI missing: `! npm i -g vercel`

## Link to existing project vs create new

Check for `.vercel/project.json` first. If present, the project is already linked to a Vercel project — reuse it:

```bash
# Skip `vercel link` — already linked.
# Proceed directly to env delivery + deploy.
```

If absent, link:

```bash
vercel link
# prompts for: scope (personal/team), project name, existing project or new
```

This creates `.vercel/project.json` (should be gitignored).

## Phase 4 — env delivery

For every key returned by `env_extract.py`:

```bash
vercel env add DATABASE_URL preview      # prompts for value, paste it
vercel env add DATABASE_URL production
```

Batch via a loop:

```bash
while IFS='=' read -r key value; do
  [ -z "$key" ] && continue
  [[ "$key" =~ ^# ]] && continue
  echo -n "$value" | vercel env add "$key" preview
  echo -n "$value" | vercel env add "$key" production
done < .env
```

Verify:

```bash
vercel env ls preview
vercel env ls production
```

Never log the values. Only the keys.

## Phase 4 — preview deploy

```bash
vercel                                # preview deploy — NOT --prod
vercel --cwd ./public                 # deploy a directory you're not cd'd into
```

> **The first deploy of a brand-new project is always production**, even without `--prod`. Vercel's docs are explicit: *"The first deployment of a new project is always a production deployment, even when you omit `--prod`. Use `--prod` for later production deployments after that first one exists."* This conflicts with Hard Rule 2, and the resolution is disclosure, not a silent exception: tell the user before running it that this first one goes live, and get an explicit yes. Every deploy after that behaves normally.

**Plain static, no framework.** Vercel detects it and skips the build: *"Vercel automatically detects eligible static deployments and makes them ready without a build step. This optimization supports deployments containing only HTML (`.html`, `.htm`) or Markdown (`.md`) files, with up to 10 files and a total size of up to 5 MB."* Bigger or mixed static sites still deploy fine — they just take the standard path.

The preview URL prints on the last non-empty stdout line, formatted like `https://<project>-<hash>-<scope>.vercel.app`. Parse it for Phase 4.5.

For a Bash tool invocation with `run_in_background: true`:

```bash
vercel 2>&1 | tee /tmp/vercel-preview.log
# Monitor /tmp/vercel-preview.log for "Preview: https://..." or "Production: https://..."
```

Extract the URL:

```bash
PREVIEW_URL=$(grep -oE 'https://[^ ]+\.vercel\.app' /tmp/vercel-preview.log | tail -1)
```

## Phase 4.5 — health check

```bash
curl -sSL -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$PREVIEW_URL"
```

2xx/3xx → promote. 4xx/5xx or empty → stop; run `vercel logs $PREVIEW_URL` for the build output.

## Phase 5 — prod promotion

```bash
vercel --prod
```

Prints the production URL (either the `.vercel.app` URL or the configured custom domain).

Cost note: Hobby is free and **personal, non-commercial use only** — see the note at the top of this file, which is stricter than it sounds. Documented Hobby limits: 100 GB fast data transfer, 1,000,000 edge requests, 1,000,000 function invocations, 200 projects, 50 domains per project, 100 deployments per day, 1-hour runtime-log retention. There is no overage billing — you are cut off: *"if you exceed your usage limits on the Hobby plan, you will have to wait until 30 days have passed before you can use the feature again."* Current terms: `https://vercel.com/pricing`

## Phase 6 — post-deploy

```bash
curl -sSL -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "https://<prod-url>"
vercel env ls production               # confirm env is set
```

**Rollback:** (verify with `vercel rollback --help` — command availability has shifted between CLI versions)
```bash
vercel rollback                        # interactive picker (recent CLI)
# or address a specific deployment:
vercel rollback https://<previous-deployment>.vercel.app

# If `rollback` is unavailable in your CLI version, promote an older deployment:
vercel promote <deployment-id-or-url>
```

**Logs:**
```bash
vercel logs <url> --follow
vercel logs                            # most recent deployment
```

## Common pitfalls

- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` / `VITE_*` env vars** are baked into the built bundle and visible client-side. Never put secrets in them.
- **Build-time vs runtime:** vars used during `next build` must exist at build. Set them in `preview` and `production` environments.
- **Custom domain SSL:** after adding a domain, certificate provisioning can take a minute. Wait for status to flip to "Valid Configuration" before promoting any custom-domain-dependent feature.
- **Team vs personal scope:** `vercel link` can quietly connect to the wrong scope. Verify with `vercel projects ls`.
- **Monorepo root directory:** if deploying from a subdirectory of a monorepo, set `rootDirectory` in the project's Vercel settings (dashboard) or via `vercel.json`.
- **Preview URL auth:** Vercel Pro teams can require auth on preview URLs, which breaks the Phase 4.5 curl check. Either disable "Vercel Authentication" for the project, or probe a public endpoint.
- **The first deploy of a new project is production.** Say so before running it, not after.
- **Hobby is non-commercial, and "commercial" includes being paid to build it.** This is the most common way people end up in breach without realising. For a client's page, Cloudflare Pages is the free option that doesn't have this problem.
- **`vercel --yes --prod`** accepts every setup default non-interactively — convenient in CI, dangerous the first time, because it will happily create a project you didn't mean to create.

## `vercel.json` (when you need it)

Most Next.js / Vite / Astro projects need no `vercel.json`. Reach for it when:
- Setting custom headers (cache-control, CSP).
- Rewriting paths to custom domains.
- Overriding the build command or output directory.
- Configuring serverless function limits.

Minimal example:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "pnpm build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": null
}
```
