# Environment-variable mapping

How env vars move from a local `.env` to each supported target. Use in Phase 4 before the preview runs.

## Source of truth

The local `.env` is the authoritative source during development. **Never commit it.** `.env.example` (or `.env.sample`) lists the keys without values for onboarding and for the audit's completeness check.

For cloud deploys, the local `.env` values must be pushed to the target's secret store *before* the preview is built — most targets inject env vars at build + runtime.

## Vercel

Vercel separates env vars by environment: `development`, `preview`, `production`. Build-time and runtime vars share the same interface.

### Push from local `.env` to Vercel

```bash
# Add a single key, prompting for the value:
vercel env add DATABASE_URL preview
vercel env add DATABASE_URL production

# Pipe a value in non-interactively:
echo -n "$DATABASE_URL" | vercel env add DATABASE_URL preview
echo -n "$DATABASE_URL" | vercel env add DATABASE_URL production

# Pull what Vercel already has (into a gitignored local file):
vercel env pull .env.vercel.local

# For bulk upload from an existing .env, see the loop example in
# references/targets/vercel.md (Phase 4 — env delivery).
```

### Verify

```bash
vercel env ls production
vercel env ls preview
```

### NEXT_PUBLIC_* caveat

For Next.js / Vite / Astro: any var that needs to be readable from client-side code must be prefixed appropriately (`NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `VITE_`, `PUBLIC_`). These are baked into the built bundle and visible to anyone inspecting the page — never put secrets in them.

## Railway

Railway stores env vars per service (project → environment → service). All vars are available at build and runtime.

### Push from local `.env`

```bash
# One at a time:
railway variables --set "DATABASE_URL=postgres://..."

# Batch from a local .env (loop — no single-command bulk import exists):
while IFS='=' read -r key value; do
  [ -z "$key" ] && continue
  [[ "$key" =~ ^# ]] && continue
  railway variables --set "$key=$value"
done < .env
```

For very large `.env` files, the Railway dashboard's "Raw Editor" accepts a pasted `.env` block directly. CLI syntax has varied across versions — `railway variables --help` for the current flag names.

### Verify

```bash
railway variables
```

### Reference another service

Railway lets one service reference another's env vars (e.g., the app uses the Postgres add-on's `DATABASE_URL`):

```
DATABASE_URL=${{ Postgres.DATABASE_URL }}
```

Written into the app service's env via `railway variables --set ...`.

## Docker + SSH VPS

Two common patterns:

### Pattern 1: `environment:` block in `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
services:
  app:
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
      - STRIPE_SECRET=${STRIPE_SECRET}
```

The host shell reads from a `.env` file next to `docker-compose.yml`. Push `.env.production` to the host:

```bash
scp .env.production user@host:/app/.env
# then on the host:
ssh user@host 'cd /app && docker compose up -d --pull=always'
```

### Pattern 2: Inline secrets via SSH

For one-off deploys, pipe env at compose time:

```bash
ssh user@host 'cat > /app/.env' < .env.production
```

**Never** commit a `.env.production` file to git. Use `.gitignore` entry `.env.*` (with `.env.example` allowlisted).

### Verify

```bash
ssh user@host 'cd /app && docker compose config'   # prints resolved compose with env expanded (redact before sharing)
ssh user@host 'cd /app && docker compose exec app env | grep -v ^_'
```

## cloudflared tunnel

Local server → public URL. Env vars stay **local** — cloudflared is just a tunnel, there is no remote environment to push to. The server reads `process.env.X` from the current shell (your machine's `.env` loaded via `dotenv` or the framework's equivalent).

## Static hosts — Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Render, Vercel static

**There is nothing to push, and offering to push something is actively harmful.**

A static host serves the publish directory to anyone who asks. Nothing runs on the server. A "build-time environment variable" — `VITE_*`, `PUBLIC_*`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, `GATSBY_*` — is **substituted into the JavaScript bundle during the build** and shipped as a literal string in a file. It is not fetched at runtime from a secret store; there is no runtime. A private repo changes nothing, because the repo is not what's being served.

So: **never say "set it as an environment variable so it stays secret."** On a static site that sentence is false, and the person hearing it has no way to know.

Two things that legitimately belong in shipped static files:

| Kind | Example | What actually protects it |
|---|---|---|
| Publishable by design | Stripe `pk_live_…` | Nothing needs to — it can only create, not charge |
| Restricted by origin | Google Maps `AIza…` | An HTTP-referrer restriction **you must set** in Google Cloud Console |
| Public configuration | Analytics ID, public API base URL | Nothing. It's public and that's fine |

Ship those, and say out loud that they are public. `static_check.py` flags them as a **warning**, not a critical, for exactly this reason — blocking a correctly-built site would train people to ignore the audit.

Anything else — a database URL, an OpenAI or Anthropic key, a Stripe `sk_`, an SMTP password — cannot go in a static site at all. Say that plainly and move to the app pipeline.

The one exception on this list: **Cloudflare Pages Functions** and **Netlify Functions** do run server-side and take real secrets.

```bash
npx wrangler pages secret put <KEY> --project-name <PROJECT>   # Cloudflare Pages Functions
netlify env:set <KEY> <value>                                  # Netlify Functions
```

Those are server code living next to a static site, not the static site itself.

## Summary table

| Target | Where vars live | How to push | How to verify |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vercel | Per-environment (dev/preview/prod), dashboard or CLI | `vercel env add KEY <env>` | `vercel env ls <env>` |
| Railway | Per-service, per-environment | `railway variables --set KEY=value` | `railway variables` |
| Docker+SSH | `.env` file on host + compose `environment:` | `scp .env.production host:/app/.env` | `docker compose config` |
| cloudflared | Local shell only | N/A — local | `env \| grep YOUR_KEY` |
| Cloudflare Pages | Nothing for static. Functions only | `wrangler pages secret put KEY` | `wrangler pages secret list` |
| Netlify | Nothing for static. Functions only | `netlify env:set KEY value` | `netlify env:list` |
| GitHub Pages | **Nothing.** No server at all | N/A | N/A |
| Render (static) | Build-time only, and public | Dashboard / `render.yaml` | Dashboard |

## Build-time vs runtime — the distinction that actually matters

This is the one piece of env-var knowledge worth getting exactly right, because getting it wrong leaks credentials in a way that looks fine in the dashboard.

- **Runtime** — read by server code at request time. Lives in the host's secret store, never reaches the browser. Genuinely secret.
- **Build-time** — substituted into the output during the build. Ends up as a literal string inside a JavaScript file that ships to every visitor. **Not secret, no matter where you typed it.**

Any variable whose name starts with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `VITE_`, `PUBLIC_`, `GATSBY_` or `REACT_APP_` is build-time by convention — the prefix exists specifically to mark "this will be public." Frameworks use the prefix as the opt-in precisely because the alternative is leaking by accident.

A **fully static site has no runtime at all**, so every variable is build-time and every variable is public. See the static-hosts section above.

**Vercel specifics:** build-time vars are read at `vercel build` and apply to both `preview` and `production`; runtime vars are available in server and edge functions at request time. When in doubt, set the var for both environments.

## Redaction rules

When reporting env status to the user, **never print values**. Only print keys. Example audit output:

> Set on Vercel (preview): DATABASE_URL, STRIPE_SECRET, SENTRY_DSN
> Missing: REDIS_URL

Never:

> Set DATABASE_URL=postgres://real:password@host/db ✓

Even in debug output.
